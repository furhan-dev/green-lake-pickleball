        Green Lake Pickleball (GLP) is the name we've chosen for the informal group of players who gather for "drop-in" play at the Green Lake East courts located near the Community Center.  GLP is NOT a club; we don't collect dues and we have neither a charter, nor a governance board, nor any formal club officers.  But we do have a mission: to create and sustain a fun, inclusive, and challenging pickleball environment for players of all abilities.  Player donations support our expenses (court reservations, balls, nets, etc.) and your active participation sustains and enriches the unique pickleball community at Green Lake.
